Bubbles keep fallin' on my head
and just like the guy whose feet are too big for his bed
nothin' seems to fit
those Bubbles are fallin' on my head, they keep fallin'

so i just did me some talkin' to the sun
and i said i didn't like the way he got things done
sleepin' on the job
those Bubbles are fallin' on my head, they keep fallin'

but there's one thing i know
the blues they send to meet me won't defeat me
it won't be long till happiness steps up to greet me

Bubbles keep fallin' on my head
but that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin' red
cryin's not for me

'cause i'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin'
because i'm free
nothin's worryin' me

it won't be long till happiness steps up to greet me

Bubbles keep fallin' on my head
but that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin' red
cryin's not for me
'cause i'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin'
because i'm free
nothin's worryin' me
